# PDF_LLM_ChatBot
This project is designed to enhance document interaction by enabling users to upload a PDF file and engage with it through a chatbot interface. The system allows users to ask questions related to the content of the uploaded PDF, and the chatbot intelligently responds based on the information contained within the document.
